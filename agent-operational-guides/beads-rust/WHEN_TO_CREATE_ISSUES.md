# When to Create New Issues

> Guidance for agents on recognizing and filing discovered work in beads_rust (br).

**Note:** Examples assume `id.prefix=br`.

## The Core Question

While working on issue `br-X`, you encounter something unexpected. Should you:

1. Handle it now (scope creep risk)
2. Ignore it (lost context risk)
3. File a new issue (overhead, but preserves knowledge)

This document helps you decide.

## The Decision Framework

### Create an Issue When

**The work is real but out of scope:**
- You're implementing auth and notice the password hashing is weak
- You're fixing a bug and see another unrelated bug nearby
- You're adding a feature and realize a prerequisite is missing

**The work would survive compaction:**
- Would a future agent need this context?
- Is this something that matters beyond this session?
- Would forgetting this cause problems later?

**The work has dependencies:**
- It blocks or is blocked by other work
- Multiple issues relate to the same root cause
- It's part of a larger pattern you're noticing

### Don't Create an Issue When

**It's part of your current scope:**
- Edge cases you should handle anyway
- Tests for the feature you're building
- Documentation for what you're implementing

**It's trivial and immediate:**
- A typo you can fix in 10 seconds
- A missing import
- An obvious cleanup in code you're already touching

**It's speculative:**
- "We might need this someday"
- "This could be a problem if..."
- Premature optimization opportunities

## The `discovered-from` Pattern

When you create an issue while working on another, link them:

```bash
br create "Weak password hashing in auth module" \
  --type bug --priority 1 \
  -d "While implementing OAuth (br-X), noticed password hashing uses MD5. Security risk."

# Assume new issue ID is br-201
br update br-201 \
  --design "Replace MD5 with bcrypt in auth/password.go" \
  --acceptance "Passwords hashed with bcrypt. Existing MD5 hashes migrated on next login."

br dep add br-201 br-X --type discovered-from
```

**Why link?**
- Creates audit trail (how was this found?)
- Helps future agents understand context
- Shows patterns (if br-X keeps spawning discoveries, maybe br-X is underspecified)

**Tip:** Use `--type discovered-from` to make the relationship explicit.

## Priority Heuristics

When filing discovered work, consider:

| Situation | Priority | Rationale |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Security issue | P0-P1 | Don't defer security |
| Blocks your current work | P1 | You can't finish without it |
| Would block future work | P2 | Important but not urgent |
| Nice-to-have improvement | P3 | Backlog material |
| Vague concern | Don't file | Clarify first or note in current issue |

## Type Selection

| What you found | Type |
|----------------|------|
| Something broken | `bug` |
| Missing capability needed | `feature` |
| Code quality / tech debt | `chore` |
| Larger scope than expected | `epic` (then decompose) |
| Investigation needed | `task` with clear acceptance criteria |

## Writing for Future Agents

The issue you create may be worked by:
- A different agent instance
- You, after compaction (effectively a different agent)
- A human reviewing the backlog

**Make the issue self-contained:**

```bash
# ❌ Bad - requires context from current session
br create "Fix the thing we discussed" --type bug --priority 2 \
  -d "The auth issue from earlier"

# ✓ Good - stands alone
br create "Fix session token expiration check" --type bug --priority 2 \
  -d "Session tokens are validated for format but not expiration. Found while implementing OAuth refresh (br-X). Allows use of expired tokens until server restart."

# Assume new issue ID is br-202
br update br-202 \
  --acceptance "Expired tokens rejected with 401. Token expiration checked on every authenticated request."
```

## The Compaction Test

Ask yourself: *If my context compacted right now and a fresh agent picked up this issue, would they understand what to do?*

If yes → the issue is well-written.
If no → add more context to description/acceptance.

## Continue or Block?

After filing a discovered issue, should you continue your current work or switch?

**Continue current work when:**
- Discovered issue doesn't block you
- You're close to completing current task
- Discovered issue is lower priority

**Consider switching when:**
- Discovered issue is P0 (security, data loss)
- Current work is blocked by the discovery
- Discovered issue is quick and you have full context now

**When uncertain:** File the issue with good context and continue. The issue preserves your knowledge; the priority system will surface it appropriately.

**Quick capture:** If you only have a minute, use `br q` to create a placeholder issue, then fill in description/design/acceptance later.

## The Agent Work Cycle

### Claiming Work

Use `--claim` to atomically take ownership:

```bash
br update br-42 --claim
```

This sets `status=in_progress` and `assignee` in one operation. It also:
- Fails if the issue is already assigned to someone else
- Fails if the issue is blocked by open dependencies

Use `--force` to bypass the blocked check if you know what you're doing.

### Finding the Next Issue

After closing an issue, run `br ready` to see what is unblocked and ready to pick up next.

### Chained Work with `--suggest-next`

When closing an issue, use `--suggest-next` to see what you just unblocked:

```bash
br close br-42 --reason "Implemented" --suggest-next --json
```

Returns structured data:

```json
{
  "closed": [{"id": "br-42", "title": "...", ...}],
  "skipped": [],
  "unblocked": [
    {"id": "br-43", "title": "Dependent task", "priority": 1},
    {"id": "br-44", "title": "Another dependent", "priority": 2}
  ]
}
```

This enables efficient chained workflows: close → see unblocked → claim next.

### Decomposing Epics

When creating subtasks for an epic, use `--parent` to get hierarchical IDs:

```bash
br create "Epic: Payment system" --type epic    # → br-abc123
br create "Add Stripe integration" --parent br-abc123   # → br-abc123.1
br create "Add PayPal integration" --parent br-abc123   # → br-abc123.2
```

The hierarchical IDs make the structure visible and keep related work grouped.

## Anti-Patterns

### The Scope Creep Trap
*"I'll just fix this while I'm here..."*

Risk: Never finishing your actual task. Every detour spawns more detours.

Solution: File an issue, note the location, continue your work.

### The Lost Knowledge Trap
*"I'll remember this for later..."*

Risk: You won't. Context compacts. Sessions end. Knowledge evaporates.

Solution: If it's worth remembering, it's worth an issue.

### The Issue Flood
*"Everything is an issue!"*

Risk: Backlog becomes noise. Important work drowns in trivia.

Solution: Apply the "survives compaction" test. Trivial things don't need issues.

### The Vague Issue
*"Something's wrong with auth"*

Risk: Future agent can't act on it. Issue sits forever.

Solution: If you can't write clear acceptance criteria, you don't understand the problem yet. Investigate more or note it in your current issue's design/notes instead.

### The Blocked Start
*Starting work on a blocked issue*

Risk: Wasted effort, incomplete work, merge conflicts.

Solution: Always use `--claim` which validates the issue isn't blocked. Or check `br show <id>` for blockers first.

## Summary

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Out of scope + real + worth remembering | Create issue with `discovered-from` link |
| In scope | Just do it |
| Trivial + immediate | Just do it |
| Speculative | Don't create issue |
| Can't define acceptance criteria | Investigate more first |
| Ready to start work | `br update <id> --claim` |
| Finished work | `br close <id> --suggest-next` |
